     - Examples: On-premises data centers, private cloud providers.

8. **What is the role of a hypervisor in virtualization?**
   - A **hypervisor** (also known as a virtual machine monitor) is responsible for managing and controlling virtual machines (VMs) on a physical host.
   - It allows multiple VMs to run concurrently on the same hardware by providing isolation, resource allocation, and hardware abstraction.
   - Types of hypervisors include Type 1 (bare-metal) and Type 2 (hosted).

9. **What is the difference between scalability and elasticity in cloud computing?**
   - **Scalability**:
     - Refers to the ability to handle increased load or demand by adding more resources (e.g., servers, storage) to the system.
     - Can be vertical (adding more power to existing resources) or horizontal (adding more instances).
   - **Elasticity**:
     - Refers to the automatic scaling of resources up or down based on demand.
     - Elasticity is dynamic and adjusts resources in real time.

10. **Explain the concept of serverless computing.**
    - **Serverless computing** (also known as Function as a Service, or FaaS) allows developers to run code without managing servers.
    - Developers write functions (small pieces of code) that are executed in response to events (e.g., HTTP requests, database changes).
    - Cloud providers automatically handle scaling, resource allocation, and execution.
